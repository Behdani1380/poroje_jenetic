This project solves the classic 8 Queens Problem using a Genetic Algorithm. 
The goal is to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. 
This means no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

How the Genetic Algorithm Works
The Genetic Algorithm is an optimization technique inspired by natural evolution. 
Below is the explanation of how it is applied to solve the 8 Queens Problem:
